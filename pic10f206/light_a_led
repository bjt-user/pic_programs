    ;the file extension must be .S for preprocessing the file (which is probably needed for the #include <xc.inc>
    ;you can't add .S source files from the menu, so you have to rename the file to .S (outside the IDE in a file explorer)
    ;(you also have to restart the IDE to see the renaming effect)
